# Introduction to Approval Testing

## Instructions

1) Check you can run the SupermarketTest and that it passes
2) Re-write it to use Approvals instead of assertions 
   - Use the ReceiptPrinter to convert the receipt to a string you can verify
3) Add more tests for other kinds of discount
    - note that you can see the other kinds of available discount in the SpecialOfferType enum.
    - don't worry too much about the additional argument to teller.addSpecialOffer - it's not always used
   
Note - there is a sample solution on the branch 'sample_solution'
